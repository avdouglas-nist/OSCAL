# Generate Schema

The schemas can be generated by running the script using the below format

```sh
  $ node generate-schema [options] [arguments]
```

[options] and [arguments] are optional inputs. Below is a list of options and arguments that can be used:

- ## options

| Options           | Meaning                                  |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| -v                | Run in verbose mode (see detailed log)   |
| -h                | Get help (usage guide)                   |
| -w Dir            | Working directory                        |
| --working-dir Dir | Working directory                        |

`Dir` indicates the directory relative to the project root directory, where you want the XML and JSON schemas to be created. You can use any name that you desire for the directory.
When a working directory option is not specified, the schemas will be created in the root directory.

- ## arguments

Arguments are used to pass the metaschema through command line interface. This is an alternative to using the config file. You can pass as many arguments as you wish.\

Please note that argument is only needed when you do not want to use the config file. The argument passed through CLI should not contain the pipes with format, convert or doc as in the regular schema path defined in the config file.\

For example: \

Instead of `src/metaschema/file_metaschema.xml|xml,json|xml,json|xml,json` use `src/metaschema/file_metaschema.xml`.

## RUNNING THE SCRIPT

- The generate-schema script can be run from either the script directory or other directory. When the script is run from another directory, the XML and JSON schemas will be generated in that current working directory.

- Run from the script directory without options, and use the config file to pass the source (metaschema) and the target (schema) format

```sh
  $ node generate-schema
```

- Run from the script directory with options. You can use one or more options, as specified in the [options table](#options) above

```sh
  $ node generate-schema -v
```

- Run from script directory, using CLI to pass one or more source (metaschema)

```sh
  $ node generate-schema src/metaschema/file1_metaschema.xml src/metaschema/file2_metaschema.xml
```

- Run from another directory. Change to a different directory and locate and run the generate-schema file from the current directory.

```sh
  $ node myDirectory/generate-schema
```
