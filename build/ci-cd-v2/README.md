# Generate Schema & Generate Content Converters

The schema files are generated by running the script using the format below

```sh
  $ node generate-schema [options] [arguments]
```

The convert files are generated by running the script in the format below

```sh
  $ node generate-content-converters [options] [arguments]
```

[options] and [arguments] are optional inputs. Below is a list of options and arguments that can be used:

- ## options

| Options           | Meaning                                  |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| -v                | Run in verbose mode (see detailed log)   |
| -h                | Get help (usage guide)                   |
| -w Dir            | Working directory                        |
| --working-dir Dir | Working directory                        |



`Dir` indicates the directory relative to the project root directory, where you want the generated XML and JSON directories to be created for `schema` and `convert`. You can use any name that you desire for the directory.
When a working directory option is not specified, the directories will be created in the root directory.

- ## arguments

Arguments are used to pass the metaschema through command line interface. This is an alternative to using the config file. You can pass as many arguments as you wish.

`Please note` that the argument is only needed when you do not want to use the config file. The argument passed through CLI should not contain the pipes with format, convert or doc as in the regular schema/convert path defined in the config file.

For example:

Instead of `src/metaschema/file_metaschema.xml|xml,json|xml,json|xml,json` use `src/metaschema/file_metaschema.xml`.

## USAGE

- The generate-schema as well as generate-content-converters script can be run from either the script directory or any other directory. When the script is run from any other directory, the XML and JSON directories would be generated in that directory.

- Run from the script directory, without options, while using the config file to generate schema/convert files

```sh
  $ node generate-schema
```
```sh
  $ node generate-content-converters
```

- Run from the script directory, with options. You can use one or more options, as specified in the [options table](#options) above

```sh
  $ node generate-schema -v
```

```sh
  $ node generate-content-converters -v
```

- Run from the script directory, using CLI to pass arguments

```sh
  $ node generate-schema src/metaschema/file1_metaschema.xml src/metaschema/file2_metaschema.xml
```

```sh
  $ node generate-content-converters src/metaschema/file1_metaschema.xml src/metaschema/file2_metaschema.xml
```

- Running from another directory. Change to the desired directory and locate the generate-schema or generate-content-converters file to run it.

```sh
  $ node otherDirectory/generate-schema
```

```sh
  $ node otherDirectory/generate-content-converters
```
